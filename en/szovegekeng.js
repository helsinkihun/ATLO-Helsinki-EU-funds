<b>How much money is at stake?</b><br><br>Suspended EU payments for Hungary amount to EUR 21.8 billion including cohesion and home affairs funds of the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and recovery funds of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). This means that up until 2024, EUR  9.7 billion under the on-going MFF as well as EUR 0.9 billion in the form of  pre-financing under the RRF become available.
<br><br><br><b>
What is the legal basis for suspension?</b><br><br>
The financial measures are possible under three Regulations attached to the Union budget:<br>
<ul>
    <li>The Regulation laying down common provisions on eight EU Funds.</li>
    <li>The Regulation establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility.</li>
    <li>The Regulation on the rule of law conditionality mechanism.</li>
</ul><br><b>
How could the funds be released?</b><br><br>
The unfreezing of EU funds is conditional on the implementation of a series of anti-corruption and rule of law related remedial measures as well as compliance with multiple strategic policy requirements. The concerning measures have been proposed by Hungary in the conditionality procedure, and in the Hungarian recovery plan. There are key areas, i.e. violation of rights of scholars, sexual minorities and asylum seekers where the Hungarian government has not indicated any remedial measures.<br><br>
Two key EU institutions, the European Commission and the Council have been involved in detecting issues related to corruption, human rights violations and attacks on independent courts. These two institutions are also in a position to lift suspension as soon as the remedial measures are duly implemented.<br><br><br>
The graph below shows how the implementation of each remedial measure could release all the suspended EU payments. This would first require the strengthening of judicial independence (1). That should be followed by the implementation of the 17 anti-corruption measures undertaken by the Hungarian government in the conditionality mechanism (2). Thirdly, violation of fundamental rights and freedoms in three areas should be remedied (3).  At last, in 11 public policy areas, an appropriate level of strategic planning should be ensured (4). <br><br>

<b>Which are the affected Hungarian programmes?</b><br><br>
Hungary is eligible for a total of EUR 22 billion from 8 EU Funds in the 2021-2027 programming period.  The 22 billion is distributed into 10 + 1 operational programmes:
<ol type='1' >
        <li>Integrated Transport Development Operational Programme (ITDOP Plus)</li>
        <li>Territorial and Settlement Development Operational Programme (TSDOP Plus)</li>
        <li>Environmental and Energy Efficiency Operational Programme (EEOP Plus)</li>
        <li>Economic Development and Innovation Operational Programme (EDIOP Plus)</li>
        <li>Human Resources Development Operational Programme (HRDOP Plus)</li>
        <li>Digital Renewal Operational Programme (DROP Plus)</li>
        <li>Hungarian Fisheries Operational Programme (HFOP Plus)</li>
        <li>8Programme of Hungary for support (AMIF)</li>
        <li>Programme of Hungary for support (ISF)</li>
        <li>Programme of Hungary for support (BMVI)</li>
        <li class='custom-list'>Implementation Operational Programme (IOP Plus)</li>
    </ol>
`



var ch1=`
The largest portion of EU funds is allocated to EDIOP, while the smallest programme is HFOP.<br><br>
Operational Programmes, with one exception, are built of so-called specific objectives setting out minor development goals which are consistent with the main priorities of each programme.<br><br>
For example, HRDOP PLUS which outlines developments in public education and social services, consists of 8 specific objectives, which are designed to strengthen Roma integration, improve labour market conditions for women or raise salaries of teachers in public education.<br><br> 
The exception is IOP PLUS, which does not foresee development goals, but contributes to the improvement of national authorities managing the implementation of the EU budget for the efficient and timely utilisation of Union funds.<br><br> 
`

var ch2=`
<b>EU funds suspended under the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR)</b><br><br>
"Common provisions" stipulate compulsory preconditions that must be fulfilled before the realisation of EU payments. Member States must ensure that freedoms and human rights enshrined in the Charter are respected and an appropriate strategic policy framework is in place during the implementation of the operational programmes.<br><br>
The European Commission assesses and approves the programmes submitted by Member States. In its decision, the Commission identifies the affected specific objective(s) in the event of breaches of fundamental rights and, when applicable, non-compliance with strategic policy requirements. Expenditures linked to the affected objectives cannot be reimbursed until the relevant enabling conditions are fulfilled.<br><br>
<ol type="A" start="1"><li><b>A.	Independence of the judiciary (Article 47 of the Charter)</b></li></ol><br>
The most comprehensive breach concerning the Hungarian programmes related to the shortcomings concerning the independence of the judiciary.<br><br>
The European Commission found that the justice system in Hungary failed to guarantee the fundamental right to an effective remedy and a fair trial. Under these circumstances, the effective application of EU law, including  the compliance with the Charter could not be ensured which affected all Hungarian operational programmes. The exception to this was IOP Plus, which does not contain specific development objectives.<br><br>
<br>Due to deficiencies around judicial independence, Hungary’s access to EUR 21.3 funding was blocked until the identified issues were properly addressed. To unblock the funds, Hungary strengthened elements of judicial independence in four areas:
<ol type='1' >
<li>Strengthening the role and powers of the National Judicial Council to counterbalance the powers of the President of the National Office for the Judiciary</li>
<li>Strengthening judicial independence of the Supreme Court (Kúria)</li>
<li>Removing obstacles to references for preliminary rulings to the Court of Justice of the European Union</li>
<li>Removing the possibility for public authorities to challenge final decisions before the Constitutional Court</li>
</ol>
The judicial reform for reinfocing judicial independence was adopted by the Hungarian Parliament on 3 May 2023 and submitted to the European Commission for evaluation in July 2023. On 13 December 2023, the Commission lifted the suspension of all relevant operational programmes by approving the reform.<br><br>
<i><b>The decision unfroze funds which are not blocked by additional issues pertaining to corruption, fundamental rights violations and the lack of appropriate policy framework. The released funding amounts to EUR 8,8 billion.</b></i>

`

var ch3=`
<b>Additional funding suspended for the violations of fundamental rights and freedoms</b><br><br>
Hungary fails to respect multiple fundamental rights enshrined in the EU Charter in four areas:<br><br>
<ol type='1' >
<li>Academic freedom is infringed in Hungarian universities maintained by public interest asset management trusts.</li>
<li>LGBTQI rights are violated by provisions of Hungary’s homophobic propaganda law (Act LXXIX of 2021).</li>
<li>The right to asylum is denied due to systemic shortcomings of the Hungarian asylum system.</li>
<li>The right to an effective remedy and a fair trial is not guaranteed by the Hungarian judiciary.</li>
</ol>
Following the approval of the Hungarian judicial reform, EUR 2.7 billion remains blocked due to fundamental rights violations in the remaining three areas.
`


var ch4=`
<ol type="A" start="2"><li><b>Freedom of the arts and sciences (Article 13 of the Charter):</b></li></ol><br>
The European Commission has found that scientific research is not free of constraints at those universities which have been transformed from public universities into publicly funded private universities, maintained by newly established public interest asset management trusts.<br><br>
Due to the governing structure of these bodies, there is a serious risk that the courses and research projects, are politically influenced as well as the staff will be selected on the basis of their alignment with the university management’s political views instead of merit and expertise.<br><br>
Violations of academic freedom relate to those specific objectives of the EDIOP PLUS and DROP PLUS programmes which set out higher education development goals.<br><br>
EDIOP PLUS:
<ul><li>Empowerment of disadvantaged students (ESO4.6)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Research and development capacity building for higher education institutions (RSO1.1)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Capacity building for small and medium size enterprises (RSO1.4)</li></ul>
DROP PLUS:
<ul><li>Fostering cooperation between higher education institutions and private enterprises in research and development (DRSO1.1)</li></ul>
<i><b>EUR 2.7 billion is suspended until academic freedom is respected</b></i>


`

var ch5=`
<ol type="A" start="3"><li><b>LGBTQI Rights (Article 1, 7, 11, 21 of the Charter):</b></li></ol><br>
The European Commission found that Hungary’s homophobic "propaganda law" (Act LXXIX of 2021) violates the rights to human dignity, respect for private and family life, freedom of thought and conscience and non-discrimination of persons belonging to sexual minorities by prohibiting the portrayal of divergence from self-identity corresponding to sex at birth, sex change or homosexuality' for individuals under the age of 18.<br><br>
In July 2021, the Commission launched an infringement procedure against Hungary concerning this legislation. The case is pending in front of the court of Justice of the EU.<br><br>
The violation of LGBTQI rights relates to those special objectives of EDIOP PLUS, HRDOP PLUS and DROP PLUS which set out goals for the developments in public education.<br><br>
EDIOP PLUS:
<ul><li>Training for in-service teachers in vocational schools and development an advanced career guidance system for vocational students (ESO4.5)</li></ul>
HRDOP PLUS:
<ul><li>Improving educational integration of disadvantaged children (EESO4.11)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Training for parents and foster parents and capacity building for workers in the social and child protection system (EESO4.6)</li></ul>
DROP PLUS:
<ul><li>Promoting digital education in public education and developing a digital curriculum (DESO4.5)</li></ul>
<i><b>EUR 700 million is suspended until LGBTQI rights are respected</b></i>

`

var ch6=`

<ol type="A" start="4"><li><b>Right to asylum (Article 18 of the Charter):</b></li></ol><br>
The European Commission found that the right to asylum is not respected in Hungary due to systemic irregularities and shortcomings of the asylum system.<br><br>
In December 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that the Hungarian Police's practice to collectively apprehend and expulse irregular migrants to Serbia without any assessment of their individual circumstances and without legal remedy, violates EU law. The practice bars asylum seekers from the asylum procedure, inconsistent with the prohibition of collective expulsion and deprives victims of the right to an effective judicial remedy, respect for private and family life, as well as the fundamental rights of children in concern. The implementation of the judgment is pending.<br><br>
In November 2021, the CJEU also established that provisions of the so-called “Stop-Soros” legislation criminalising the organisation of activities carried out to assist the initiation of applications for international protection, are inconsistent with EU law. The implementation of the judgment is pending.<br><br>
Hungary introduced a pre-procedure that must be completed in a Hungarian Embassy in Belgrade or Kyiv before the submission of an actual asylum claim in 2020. The CJEU delivered its judgment on the so-called “embassy system” in June 2023 establishing inconsistency between EU law and the Hungarian asylum system.<br><br>
Violations of the right to asylum relates to those specific objectives of the AMIF programmes which set out goals for addressing irregular migration.:<br><br>
AMIF:
<ul><li>Strengthening the Common European Asylum System (SOM1)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Countering irregular migration (SOM3)</li></ul>
<i><b>EUR 34 million is suspended until the right to asylum is respected</b></i>

`





var ch7=`
<b>Policy enabling conditions</b><br><br>
In addition to the Charter violations in four areas, the European Commission detected noncompliance with policy enabling conditions in 11 instances.<br><br>
This means that EU funding for 23 specific objectives of the Hungarian operational programmes are suspended due to shortcomings in the policy framework (orange), 5 due to violation of fundamental rights (green) and 5 specific objectives are affected by both problems (pink).<br><br> 
The fact that payments for the affected specific objectives are suspended does not mean that the development objectives set by the Hungarian programmes will remain unimplemented. They must be completed and financed by the Hungarian national budget. The EU will reimburse the investments ex-post in the event of a successful implementation of remedial measures.

<b>Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation</b><br><br>
In its decision of 15 December 2022, the Council blocked 55 % of the budgetary commitments under 3 operational programmes that were expected to be implemented mainly through public procurement (ITDOP PLUS, TSDOP PLUS, EEEOP PLUS).<br><br>
The withdrawal of the financial measures is conditional on the proper implementation of 17 remedial measures which are designed to address weaknesses and irregularities related to public procurement procedures, national anti-corruption framework and the effectiveness of investigation and prosecution of corruption.<br><br>
The Hungarian Government shall report every three months on the state of implementation of the reforms to the European Commission. New evidence can be submitted any time, in the form of a written notification, to show that the identified shortcomings had been sufficiently addressed.<br><br> 
The Commission may assess the implementation of new measures and, in the event of positive assessment, propose the Council to withdraw the adopted financial measures or reduce suspension.<br><br> 
Up to this date, the implementation of the 17 anti-corruption measures remains incomplete. Thus, the financial restrictions adopted by the Council for the protection of the Union’s financial interests are unchanged and in place.<br><br>

<b>Recovery and Resilience Facility</b><br><br>
In addition to the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework, Member States may also benefit from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which aims to tackle the effects of the economic crisis induced by the COVID19 pandemic.<br><br>
Member States prepare national recovery plans which set out “milestones” in the reform process and an indicative timetable for the reforms to be implemented. Recovery plans shall be consistent with the main recovery objectives of the EU as well as country-specific recommendations issued in multiple EU review cycles (i. e. the European Semester and the Annual Rule of Law Report).<br><br>
Hungary's national plan was adopted by the Council on 15 December 2022. The Hungarian recovery plan outlines a reform process which is designed to improve socio-economic resilience as well as significantly advance green transition. The envisaged reforms and investments cover 9 policy areas:
<ol type='1' >
        <li>Demography and public education</li>
        <li>Qualified and competitive workforce</li>
        <li>Catching up settlements</li>
        <li>Water management</li>
        <li>Green transportation</li>
        <li>Green energy</li>
        <li>Sustainable waste management</li>
        <li>Health</li>
        <li>Governance and public administration</li>
    </ol>
Member States may submit requests for payments to the Commission in accordance with the advancement of the envisaged reforms, following the achievement of a set of milestones indicated in their national plan.<br><br>
Hungary is eligible for EUR 5.8 billion in grant and EUR 9.4 billion in loan under the RRF. The current recovery plan includes the maximum amount of grant and EUR 3.9 billion in loan for the achievement of the development objectives. There is additional funding of EUR 700 million to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels. The reforms set out in the recovery plan shall be completed by 31 August 2026.<br><br>

`

var ch21=`
As a consequence of systemic corruption and issues related to the independence of the judiciary, Hungary's recovery plan, in addition to the regular milestones and objectives, also includes 27 “super-milestones” which are designed to upgrade the national anti-corruption framework and strengthen the integrity of the judiciary for the protection of the Union’s financial interests. 17 out of the 27 “super-milestones” are identical to the remedial measures proposed under the conditionality regulation and 4 “super-milestones” are equivalent to the judicial reforms implemented under the CPR.<br><br>
All identified “super milestones” shall be fulfilled before the submission of the first payment request under the RRF.<br><br>
<i><b>Recovery funding of EUR 9.5 billion remains conditional on the achievement of the 27 “super milestones”.</b></i>

<b>The Procedures</b><br><br>
<u>Rule of law conditionality mechanism</u><br><br>
The procedure is designed to protect the Union’s financial interest in the event of breaches of the principles of the rule of law in a Member State that have an impact on the sound financial management of EU funds in a sufficiently direct way. Financial measures are adopted by the Council based on the Commission’s proposal. Hungary is obliged to implement seventeen remedial measures aiming to strengthen the overall anti-corruption framework. Suspended funds are lost to the Member State should the implementation of the identified remedial measures be incomplete after two years from the year of the Council decision.<br><br>
<div class="gombpanel"><div class="valtogomb readmore1">Find out more!</div></div><br><br>
<u>Common Provisions Regulation</u><br><br>
There are five cohesion Funds and three migration and home affairs Funds providing financial support under the multiannual financial framework. The CPR lays down financial rules for eight and common provisions for three EU Funds.<br><br>
The common provisions stipulate compulsory preconditions that must be fulfilled. Member States must ensure that fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter are respected during the implementation of the national operative programmes. Moreover, with regard to three Funds (European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund) MSs shall comply with thematic enabling conditions as well.<br><br>
In the Hungarian case, the European Commission identified breaches of the Charter in four areas. In addition, eleven thematic enabling conditions have not been met. 
<br><br>
<div class="gombpanel"><div class="valtogomb readmore2">Find out more!</div></div><br><br>
<u>Recovery and Resilience Facility</u><br><br>
The RRF aims to put the Union on a recovery track after the economic crisis induced by the COVID19 pandemic. The general objective of the Recovery and Resilience Facility is to advance the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union as well as to improve the resilience, preparedness and productivity of Member States. <br><br>
The Commission may assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of national recovery plans. In the event of a positive assessment, on a proposal from the Commission, the recovery and resilience plan is approved by the Council. <br><br>
During the implementation of the national plan, Member States take all the appropriate measures to protect the financial interests of the Union and to ensure that the use of funds complies with the applicable Union and national law, in particular regarding the prevention, detection and correction of fraud, corruption and conflicts of interests.
The Council adopted the Hungarian recovery plan in December 2022. However, as a consequence of irregularities and shortcoming of the anti-corruption framework and deficiencies in judicial independence the disbursement of recovery funds are suspended.

<b>Timeline of events</b><br><br>
<ul><li>16 December 2020</li></ul>
The European Parliament and the Council adopted the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32020R2092"target="_blank">Regulation</a> on a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget
<ul><li>16 February 2022</li></ul>
The CJEU confirmed the validity of the Conditionality Regulation. In March 2021, Hungary and Poland challenged the Regulation in front of the Court of Justice of the European Union, claiming that the EU bodies had exceeded their powers by adopting the regulation m. However, the EU Court of Justice upheld the mechanism.
<ul><li>5 April 2022</li></ul>
The European Commission sent a ‘notification letter’ to Hungary on the launch of the rule of law conditionality mechanism which pointed out systemic irregularities and weaknesses concerning i.) public procurement procedures; ii) correction of conflicts of interest and to the use of EU funds by public interest asset management foundations; iii.) investigation and prosecution; iv.) anti-corruption framework.
<ul><li>22 August 2022</li></ul>
 The Hungarian Government proposed 17 remedial measures to remedy the shortcomings identified in the Commission’s ‘notification letter’.
<ul><li>19 September 2022</li></ul>
The Commission presented its proposal on the suspension of 65% of 3 Hungarian operational programmes and any financial commitments to public interest trusts and entities maintained by them for the protection of the Union budget against breaches of the principles of the rule of law. Hungary had 2 months to complete the key implementation steps of the proposed 17 remedial measures.
<ul><li>30 November 2022</li></ul>
The Commission assessed that the key implementation steps of the proposed remedial measures were incomplete and maintained its earlier proposal to the Council for financial measures.
<ul><li>15 December 2022</li></ul>
The Council adopted its implementing decision on measures for the protection of the Union budget with a reduced 55% suspension of funding from 3 OPs. The Council also adopted the Hungarian RRP which includes 27 ‘super milestones’ aiming to remedy  long-standing anti-corruption and rule of law problems.
<ul><li>22 December 2022</li></ul>
The Commission approved Hungary’s Partnership Agreement and 11 operational programmes. The decisions on approving the various programmes indicated that the compliance with the Charter and in some cases policy requirements were not met. <br><br>
Until Hungary remedies the detected issues in the 4 areas, payments are  suspended for those specific objectives that are related to the identified human right violations.<br><br>
<ul><li>13 December 2023</li></ul>
The Commission released those EU funds which were not blocked by additional issues pertaining to the application of the Charter, corruption or shortcomings of the national policy framework. 
Payments of EUR 12 billion under the MFF and EUR 9.5 billion under the RRF remain  conditional on the implementation of a series of remedial measures.

A breach of principles of the rule of law may fall under the scope of the conditionality procedure when the proper functioning of the authorities implementing the Union budget is not guaranteed, in particular, in the context of public procurement or grant procedures. The Commission may notify the Member State in concern about the detected irregularities and shortcomings and the Member State may propose remedial measures in its response.<br><br>
If the European Commission considers that such a situation exists in a Member State and cannot be remedied by other EU procedures, it notifies the government, indicating the problems. In response, the Member State may propose corrective measures.<br><br>
If the European Commission considers that the corrective measures do not adequately address the situation or are not properly implemented, it will propose to the Council proportionate measures to protect the EU budget. The Council decides by qualified majority on the proposal or may amend it. In order to protect the EU budget, the Council may suspend payments in progress or prohibit new commitments against the EU budget.<br><br>
